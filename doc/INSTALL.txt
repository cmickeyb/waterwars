INSTALL

== Requirements ==
Water Wars requires 

* OpenSimulator 0.7.5

* Installation of an OpenSimulator groups module.  For example, the XmlRpcGroups
server hosted at
https://github.com/mcortez/flotsam/tree/master/flotsam/Servers/XmlRpcGroupsServer/

* Use of the MySQL OpenSimulator database service.  This is for reasons of speed
- the SQLite module is too slow to handle the object rezzing and deletion that
the game requires.

* An installation of Apache or some other external webserver.  This is required
to display and operate the in-game webpage.
This webserver must have PHP installed, which itself must have the PHP curl
module installed.

== Installation ==
There are a number of steps required to install Water Wars.

1) Make the following edits to your OpenSimulator configuration file (e.g.
OpenSim.ini)

* In the [Startup] section, set MinimumTimeBeforePersistenceConsidered = 60000
and MaximumTimeBeforePersistenceConsidered = 60000.  Water Wars doesn't
currently persist game data, so there is actually no point persisting
game objects since they will be reset by the game when
OpenSimulator is restarted.  The act of persisting the game objects can lead to
considerable slow down where the region database is slow.  Increasing these two
settings to these numbers will stop persistence taking place.

If you have a fast database you may be able to leave these settings at their
original figures.

* In the [ODEPhysicsSettings] section, set mesh_sculpted_prim = false.  This is
because some of the sculpted prims used in OpenSim cause meshing failures on
64 bit systems.  These failures lead to an eventual failure of OpenSimulator
itself.  If you don't see errors, you might be okay leave this as true.

You can also make the following optional changes

* In [Startup], set DefaultDrawDistance = 767.0  This allows a client to see the
entire game area at once.  However, the game will operate as normal if this is
not set or set to a different value.

2) Copy bin/NewtonSoft.Json.Net20.dll into OpenSimulator's bin/ directory.

3) Copy the regions/ww-regions.ini file into your OpenSimulator bin/Regions
directory.  If you want to run only Water Wars regions (recommended), then
please also remove any existing config files in bin/Regions

The regions are laid out in the following pattern

04 | 14 | 24 | 34
03 | 13 | 23 | 33
02 | 12 | 22 | 32

where each number is prefixed by "RioGrande " (e.g. 04 is "RioGrande 04").

Any of the region details can be changed, including the name.  However, their
relative positions must be retained (e.g. 23 must be immediately east of 13).

4) Start OpenSimulator.  On startup, it will ask you to assign each region to an
estate.  Each region should belong to the same estate (the estate can have any
name).  The estate owner should be a user called "Water Wars".  This user will
own all the game objects that don't belong to a paritcular player.

5) Create the groups "Water Wars Players" and "Water Wars Administrators".

6) Load the Water Wars OpenSimulator archives (OARs) into each region.  We do
this before we install the WaterWars.dll game logic.
From the region console command line, change to the first region

# change region "RioGrande 02"

and load the OAR

# load oar ../addon-modules/waterwars/oars/rg02.oar

Do the same for each subsequent region.  Once this is done, shutdown the
simulator.

7) Make the waterwars web pages available from the external server.  These must
be reachable via the address http://hostname/waterwars  The hostname part will
be the same as the ExternalHostName parameter in each region of ww-regions.ini
(if ExternalHostName is SYSTEMIP then this is the LAN IP of your OpenSimulator server, e.g.
192.168.0.2).

You can do this either by copying web/waterwars directly to your public http
area (e.g. copy it to /var/www/waterwars on Linux) or create a link to the
distribution directory).

8) Copy bin/WaterWars.dll into your OpenSimulator bin/ directory.  If you're on
Mono and you built a debug release, then also copy over WaterWars.pdb (this is
important for obtaining line numbers, etc.)

9) Start OpenSimulator.  During startup, you should see the log message

[WATER WARS]: Initialising with scene RioGrande 04

for each region, and then later on the message

[WATER WARS]: Starting state Registration

10) [Optional] The estate owner will need to go to the capitol roundhouse building in
RioGrande 23 and edit it so that it belongs to the Water Wars Administrators
group.  This will allow people in that group to edit the game parameters in the
"Game Configuration" notecard.

11) You should now be able to play the game!  Please see the PLAYING.txt document
for more details.  I recommend you raise the logging level to INFO (this can be
done via OpenSim.exe.config).  All Water Wars logging happens at the INFO level.
